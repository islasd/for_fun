# DND Stats Dice Roller

## fun backstory

I was on a call with my friend who is the Dungeon Master (leader) for our DND (Dungeons & Dragons) campaign. He explained to me how to assign stats to my character, as this was my first time playing DND and I decided to write a program to do it.

## the rules

To create a stat number, roll a die four times. Add the three highest rolls together. There are six stats you have to roll for, so you do this process six times total.
